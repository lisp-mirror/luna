# luna

Luna is a group managment bot for matrix, however it contains a framework that can be used to make a matrix bot to do anything 
see the luna.framework system.

as of writing this isn't really usable but eventually it will be.
## license
    idk if this happens but just incase someone goes back to the start of the project to get around the license with some real cheek and if you're doing that hi but everything has copyright notices attatched also you're bad and sad because this isn't very good.
